## How Do Browsers Work?

Web browsers are like any program that opens files. Word opens DOCX and InDesign open INDD.

Browsers open HTML files located on your PC or, more likely, on a remote server. HTML files can tell the browser to pull in CSS and JavaScript files which are also understood by the browser.

## Different Languages Do Different Things

* [__HTML__ (HyperText Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) describes the structure of a webpage. It can tell the browser that an image should be displayed and be followed by a paragraph of text.
* [__CSS__ (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) describes the style of elements on the page. It can tell the browser that an image should have a 1 pixel thick black border, and that the text in a paragraph should be colored `#222222`.
* [__JavaScript__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) can make web pages dynamic. It can tell the browser that a paragraph's text should change when an image is clicked.
