# Introduction to Web Development

This repository stores notes and examples to supplement the Introduction to Web Development workshop. This workshop will teach attendees how to create a basic web site using HTML and CSS and is geared towards those with little to no programming experience.

## Demo Site

During this workshop, we've been building a site demonstrating what we've learned. You can access my version of this demo site [here](https://github.com/mrnyby/iwd-workshop/tree/master/demo), but I encourage you to tweak this and make it your own!
