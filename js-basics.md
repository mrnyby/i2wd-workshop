# JavaScript Basics

Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a true __programming language__. Like many other programming languages, JavaScript is __Turing complete__; JavaScript scripts or programs can do any possible computational task. JavaScript is one of, if not the, most prevalent programming languages in modern software development.

## Types

Like any programming language, JavaScript has a set of __types__ used to describe all of the __variables__ or data flowing through your program. Unlike statically typed languages like C or Java, developers don't need to explicitly tell JavaScript the type of a variable.

```js
var yes = true;             // Boolean
var no = false;             // Boolean
var whole = 4;              // Number
var decimal = 3.5;          // Number
var str = 'Hello, world!';  // String
var character = 'X';        // String
```
